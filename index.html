          <h2>What is Github?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds – the same person who created Linux.</p>
          <p>So, Git is a “version control system,” what’s that mean? When developers are creating something (an application, for example), they are making constant changes to the code and releasing new versions, up to and after the first official (non-beta) release. Version control systems keep these revisions straight, and store the modifications in a central repository. </p>
          <p>More on Github and how to create a simple repository, you can find <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">here</a>.</p>
          <h2>What are issues and what will we do in this tutorial</h2>
          <p>Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of the team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.</p>
          <p>We are going to use issues for keeping track of tasks in this tutorial and in out future projects. Our end product of this tutorial will be this page, that we will assemble as a team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="github-setup">
          <h1 class="page-header">Github setup</h1>
          <h2>Register &amp; login</h2>
          <p>First of all, if you don't have an account you should register <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Once you're done registering or if you already have an account, <a href="https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fjoin%3Fsource%3Dheader-home">login</a>.</p>
          <h2>Fork repository</h2>
          <p>Now, you'll need to fork <a href="https://github.com/Skaiste/glowing-chainsaw">this</a> repository.</p>
          <p><strong>What is a repository?</strong> A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.</p>
          <p><strong>What does it mean to fork a repository?</strong> Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull Requests to help make other people’s projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.</p>
          <p>To fork the repository, click the Fork button in the header of the repository.</p>

        <div class="section" id="git-setup">
          <h1 class="page-header">Setup git on your machine &amp; and clone the repo</h1>
          <h2>Mac &amp; Linux</h2>
          <p>To install git and clone the repository we'll use the terminal, so open that up.</p>
          <h3>Install git</h3>
          <p>If you don't already have git installed you'll need to download and run <a href="">this installer</a> if you're using macOS and if you're using Linux enter this command on the terminal: <br><code>$ apt-get install git</code></p>
          <p>To check if you have git on your machine enter this command:<br><code>git --version</code></p>
          <h3>Clone repository</h3>
          <p>Using commands <code>ls</code>(to find out what directory you're currently in) and <code>cd</code>(to travel from one directory to another) navigate to a directory you wish to have this project in.</p>
          <p>Open your forked repository in the browser, click on the "Clone or download" button and copy the address of your repository.</p>
          <img src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/remotes-url.png" />
          <p>Then in your terminal enter the following command, but instead of <code>url</code> use the address of your repository you have just copied<br><code>$ git clone url</code></p>
          <p>And now you should have the repository sitting locally on your machine.</p>
          <h2>Windows</h2>
          <h3>Install git</h3>
          <p>To have git on Windows, you'll need to download and run this <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">installer</a>. It installs Git GUI, from which you can create, clone and manage your repositories, and Git Bash which you can use for the same purposes just using git commands. In this tutorial we're going to use both Git GUI and Git Bash.</p>
          <h3>Clone repository</h3>
          <p>Open your forked repository in the browser, click on the "Clone or download" button and copy the address of your repository.</p>
          <img src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/remotes-url.png" />
          <p>Once you have installed git on your windows machine and copied the address of your repository, open Git GUI and click "Clone existing repository". Then paste your repository address into source location field and select your target directory as the directory you want your project to be in.</p>
          <img src="img/gitGUi.PNG" width="400px" />
          <p>Now all your repository files should be on your machine</p>
          <h2>Set up your user profile</h2>
          <p>To finish setting up git on your machine you have to set up your user profile. In order to do that you have to open your terminal (mac &amp; linux) or Git Bash (windows) and enter these two commands just replace the email and name with your details:<br><code>$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code><br><code>$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="write-code">
          <h1 class="page-header">Code writing</h1>
          <h2>Install Atom</h2>
          <p>For editting and commiting our code we'll be using a text editor called "Atom". If you don't have it yet, download and install it from <a href="https://atom.io/">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Once you have successfully installed it we'll need to install a git package that will help us easily push our changes from the text editor.<br>So in the top menu select File -> Settings -> Install, search for "git-plus" and install the package.</p>
          <h3>Open cloned project</h3>
          <p>In the top menu select File -> Open Folder... and choose the folder that your cloned project lays in.</p>
          <h2>Assigned issue</h2>
          <p>Open up the <a href="https://github.com/Skaiste/glowing-chainsaw">original repository</a> in your browser and click on the issues section. By now you should have been assigned an issue, if not then scream like a hungry baby bird, maybe someone will pay attention to you.</p>
          <img src="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/navigation-highlight.png"  width="500px"/>
          <p>Open up the issue that has been assigned to you and follow the instrctions on what you should do with your code. Here is where the scary word "team" comes in again, since we all have different tasks and we need to finish them all in order for the page to be finished. So come back to atom and make all your changes there.</p>
          <h2>Add, Commit &amp; Push</h2>
          <p>After you're done with your task, right click on your project (on your left) and select Git -> git add + commit. Then enter your commit message, saying what changes you have done and save it.</p>
          <p>When that is successfully done right click on your project again and this time select Git -> git push.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="pull-request">
          <h1 class="page-header">Pull request</h1>
          <p>You have pushed your changes to your forked repository, but not to the original one. To do that you'll need to create a pull request.</p>
          <p>So go back to the <a href="https://github.com/Skaiste/glowing-chainsaw">original repository</a> in your browser and click on the pull requests section.</p>
          <table class="table table-striped">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Screenshot</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>From the Pull Request page, click the green <strong>New pull request</strong> button.</td>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.</td>
                <td><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/diff.png" alt="diff"></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green <strong>Create Pull Request</strong> button.</td>
                <td><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/create-pr.png" alt="create-pull"></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. In your description you should include a word "close" and the issue number that was assigned to you, which will automatically close your issue after your changes have been merged with the master branch. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/">More info about that</a>.</td>
                <td><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/pr-form.png" alt="pr-form"></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="result">
          <h2>Final result</h2>
          <p>Now you'll have to wait until the creator of the original repository will decide to merge your request. And after all requests are merged you should be able to see the final result <a href="https://skaiste.github.io/glowing-chainsaw/">here</a>!</p>
